The contraceptive diaphragm was developed almost 150 years ago.
The diaphragm is proven to be the safest and most effective method of preventing unintended pregnancy,
with 93-94% effectiveness when used according to proper recommendations.

Some of the benefits of using the diaphragm over other contraceptives are:

- :moneybag: Less expensive then medications
- :recycle: Doesn't change the menstrual cycle
- :smile: No hormonal side effects, such as:
  - Moodiness and depression
  - Decreased libido
  - Reduced breast milk production
- :vertical_traffic_light: You can start and stop using it when you want
- :alarm_clock: Can be inserted several hours before use
- :restroom: Most women find that it doesn't negatively impact relations

Having done over 150 fittings,
Dr. Mansheim has proven success with fitting women for a diaphragm in only one 1-hour visit,
and she takes the time to make sure that you are happy with the results.
