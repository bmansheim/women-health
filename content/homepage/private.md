Many Israelis and foreign visitors find themselves lost in the medical system.

Instead of you running from one referral to the next without a clear picture of your condition,
in a private consultation Dr. Mansheim can review your medical history,
recommend treatment options, and refer you to other like-minded medical professionals.

And with Dr. Mansheim's emotional support based on Torah sources,
you'll feel heard and empowered to make decisions about your health.
